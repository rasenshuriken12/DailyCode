## Problem Statement

Given an array arr[] with non-negative integers representing the height of blocks. If the width of each block is 1, compute how much water can be trapped between the blocks during the rainy season.

## Examples

### Example 1:
- **Input:** `arr[] = [3, 0, 1, 0, 4, 0, 2]`
- **Output:** `10`
- **Explanation:** Total water trapped = 0 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 10 units.

### Example 2:
- **Input:** `arr[] = [3, 0, 2, 0, 4]`
- **Output:** `7`
- **Explanation:** Total water trapped = 0 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 0 = 7 units.

### Example 3:
- **Input:** `arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4]`
- **Output:** `0`
- **Explanation:** We cannot trap water as there is no height bound on both sides.

### Example 4:
- **Input:** `arr[] = [2, 1, 5, 3, 1, 0, 4]`
- **Output:** `9`
- **Explanation:** Total water trapped = 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 0 = 9 units.

## Constraints

- `1 < arr.size() < 10^5`
- `0 < arr[i] < 10^3`
